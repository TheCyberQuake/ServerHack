ServerHack is a tool to allow Switch and Xbox Minecraft to connect to
a custom dedicated bedrock server. It works by using a DNS server
to hijack one of the Featured Servers and make it our own. 

Usage:
  1.  Launch ServerHack.bat
  2.  Click yes when it asks if you want to allow it to make changes
  3.  When prompted, type in the server URL or IP you wish to connect to
  4.  The window should display what to set as the DNS server on your switch
  5.  On the switch, go to System Settings, then Internet
  6.  Go to Internet Settings, Then choose your usual network connection
  7.  Select Change Settings, DNS Settings, and set to Manual
  8.  Set Primary DNS and Secondary DNS as instructed by step 4 above
  9.  Click save, then back out of the menu
  10. Open Minecraft
  11. Once signed in to your Microsoft account, click Play
  12. Go to Servers, then load The Hive
  13. If everything is working, you should now be loaded into your server
